Smart solar LED street light.

The aim of this project is to design a Smart solar LED street light that is fully automated and consumes minimal power.
In many cities the street lights are still controlled manually and have no additional control over brightness or motion sensing.
This leads to a huge wastage of power. In this project I am developing a street light that uses PIR and Daylight sensors to turn ON/OFF
when needed. I am also using a PWM signal to control the brightness of the light.

In the next stage I am planning to get wireless control to this light.
